                To repair supply chains in these turbulent times, we are providing a safe, contactless, and fast method to deliver essential supplies to those who need them. 
                The purpose of this project is to create a service where drone delivery can be brought to anyone, anywhere. 
                To ensure we're having the greatest impact possible, we're working to provide rapid delivery to hospitals in rural areas

            <h1>What sets us Apart?</h1>
            <p class="quick-answer">
                Weâ€™re building a drone system that does not require any infrastructure, allowing us to implement this in remote areas, bringing down delivery times from hours to minutes.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="elab-answer"> Drone delivery is something that has been worked on for a long time, but governments have only recently allowed drone systems to operate commercially. 
            What sets us apart is that we're building a service for those who are not large enough to do business with the giants in the space  </br>
            </br>Instead of building warehouses and large centers, we're focused on only bringing what is necessary - the drone itself, so that anyone can use delivery, even those in the most remote areas</p>
