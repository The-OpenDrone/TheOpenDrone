            <p>To repair supply chains in these turbulent times, we are providing a safe, contactless, and fast method to deliver essential supplies to those who need them. The purpose of this project is to create a platform for makers and communities to
                create their own delivery drones, effectively creating a global drone delivery network. This project is focused on mobilizing creators and innovators to mitigate the impact of Covid-19, and can be scaled to solve problems beyond the pandemic.</p>

            <h1>What sets us Apart?</h1>
            <p class="quick-answer">We’re creating an open-source framework, to provide makers with the resources to create their own drones.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="elab-answer">Drone delivery is something that has been worked on for a long time, but the development has only recently been taken more seriously by the tech industry. What sets us apart is that we’re not creating a product. We’re creating an open-source framework,
            to provide makers with the resources to create their own drones. </br>
            </br>With this, we can have a global impact in just a few months and build up centralized systems in multiple countries in just a few years. By extrapolating historical data for drone supplies, we could see that it would easily take over a decade
            for these systems to even reach places like India, much less achieve assimilation anytime soon.</p>
